_Note:_

- _This site only contains primers for the Introduction. Other primers are still being developed!_
- _The actual database will be on a robust, sustainable platform developed in collaboration with Brown's Center for Digital Scholarship. This site just serves as a first look at the primer format for early feedback_

## About the SRC Database

The Socially Responsible Computing (SRC) program reimagines computer science education at Brown and beyond by exposing future engineers to the social impact of modern digital technology, ethical and political challenges surrounding such technologies, as well as technical and theoretical tools to address those challenges. The program develops curricula, pedagogical approaches and instructional materials to support the inclusion of SRC in a wide variety of CS courses. The SRC curriculum currently covers 7 overarching areas:

1. Data protection and privacy,
2. Automated Decision-Making: Fairness & Justice, Transparency, Reliability,
3. Communication and public discourse,
4. Accessibility and universal design,
5. Digital well-being,
6. Sustainability, and
7. Socio-political and economic context of technology.

The SRC program is developed and maintained by faculty, student researchers, and Socially Responsible Computing TAs (STAs), who are responsible for incorporating relevant content from the 7 SRC areas to develop assignments, labs and/or discussion sections for their assigned CS course. Two common questions that arise during SRC course development are “What topics do we teach?” and “Where do we find resources on these topics?” Current development practice draws upon:

1. Past SRC assignments/readings,
2. Various resources suggested by professors/STAs, and
3. STAs’ own research into these topics

The decentralized nature of this practice results in several problems that this UTRA project aims to address:

1. A lack of interdisciplinary, up-to-date, and wcell-researched materials for SRC assignments & discussion sections
2. A lack of expertise on specific SRC topics on the part of STAs and faculty
3. A lack of time and coordination for STAs and faculty across courses

Increasingly, STAs and faculty have expressed the need for a centralized database that offers accessible and well-curated resources to support the content development process.
The SRC Database Project aims to address the above challenges. It has the following features:

- Curated collections of interdisciplinary resources on the 7 SRC areas
- Short, accessible briefs/primers that contain key takeaways for each area
- Up-to-date case studies on current events that provide context and relevance for the 7 SRC areas.
- Tags tracking resource-usage by different CS courses to prevent overlap

The database is an educational tool that aims to improve the experiences of STAs, CS faculty, and CS students in a sustainable manner. Additionally, it represents a broader effort to provide resources to the growing community of faculty and students at Brown with a shared interest in advancing responsible technologies.
